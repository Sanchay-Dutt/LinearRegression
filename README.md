# LinearRegression
Small project implementing Linear Regression from scratch using NumPy and Pandas to predict salaries based on input data.

Features:
Loads and processes data from a CSV file (Salary_Data.csv)
Implements the Normal Equation (Least Squares Method) manually without using machine learning libraries
Splits data into training and test sets (80/20 split)
Fits a linear model to the training data
Predicts salaries for the test set
Evaluates model accuracy using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Displays each prediction with its actual value and percentage error
